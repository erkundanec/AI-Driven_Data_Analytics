    "Customer attrition, also known as customer churn, refers to the situation in which customers or subscribers discontinue their engagement with a company or service. The measurement of customer churn holds significant importance due to its cost-efficiency in comparison to customer acquisition. Retaining existing customers is far more cost-effective since it minimizes expenses related to sales and marketing. This is because when you retain customers, you have already established trust and secured their loyalty."

    "Multiple methods exist for calculating the churn rate, which can be expressed as either the total number of customers lost, the percentage of customers lost in relation to the total customer count, the recurring business value lost, or the percentage of recurring value lost. However, within the context of this dataset, the churn rate is defined as a binary variable for each customer, and the goal is not to calculate the rate itself. Instead, the primary objective here is to identify and quantify the factors that have an impact on the churn rate."

    "This project is relatively straightforward and suitable for beginners, as it involves a limited number of variables. It may not be the most practical application for neural networks since the dataset has relatively few training examples. However, it serves as a valuable educational tool for grasping the fundamentals of neural networks due to its simplicity and ease of understanding."
